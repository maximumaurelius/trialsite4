# Hello World

Welcome to my first blog post! This is a sample post to demonstrate the blog's functionality.

## What's this about?

This is a demonstration of the blog's markdown capabilities. You can write your posts using markdown syntax, which supports:

- **Bold text** and *italic text*
- Lists (like this one!)
- [Links](https://example.com)
- And much more

## Code Examples

Here's a sample code block:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
    console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}
```

## Images

Images can be included in your posts and will be properly styled:
